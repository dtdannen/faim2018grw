            <h1>Welcome to the 6th Goal Reasoning Workshop at IJCAI/FAIM-2018 in Stockholm, Sweden!</h1>

            <p>Goals are a unifying structure across the variety of intelligent systems, and reasoning about goals takes
                many forms. In the most encompassing view, intelligent systems can use goal structures (or goal rewards)
                to manage long-term behavior, anticipate the future, select among priorities, commit to action, generate
                expectations, assess tradeoffs, resolve the impact of notable events, or learn from experience. As a
                result, the broad topic of goal reasoning is studied in diverse subfields of AI such as motivated
                systems, cognitive science, automated planning, and agent-oriented programming to name but a few. This
                workshop aims to bring together researchers from sometimes distinct subfields to encourage
                cross-disciplinary discussion on goal reasoning. </p>

            <p>This year we will feature a joint-panel with the Engineering Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS) Workshop on the topic of: "Requirements and Goals for Agent-based Systems: From Specification and Design to Runtime Representation and Reasoning."</p>

            <p><b>Topics</b> include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theoretical models of goal reasoning</li>
                <li>The role of goals in self-motivated systems</li>

                <li>Multi-agent and distributed goal management</li>
                <li>Learning for goal reasoning</li>
                <li>Comparisons of goal reasoning with other models of autonomy</li>

            <!-- 	<p> Abstract: This  talk aims to help bridge between two communities: the Goal Reasoning  community, and the Engineering Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS) community. I  discuss broadly the different perspectives and assumptions adopted by  the two communities, and then proceed to discuss a range of relevant  work in the EMAS community. This includes both pointing out some key  relevant papers (by others) in the EMAS community, and discussing some  of my own relevant prior work. In particular, I discuss work on  representing goals, on managing interactions between concurrent goals,  and on how to select between different options for attaining a goal. I  finish by posing some challenges to the Goal Reasoning community. -->

            <!-- <h3> Michael Floyd -- Goal Reasoning in Support of Human-Robot Teams </h3> -->

            <!-- <p> Abstract: Goal Reasoning allows agents to reason about their goals and  dynamically modify them in response to opportunistic situations or  unexpected events. Goal selection and modification is typically  influenced by the environment (e.g., unexpected environment changes) or  the agent's self-evaluation (e.g., detecting plan or action failures,  reevaluating the utility of goals). Our work focuses on goal reasoning  agents that operate in environments with other intelligent agents (e.g.,  teammates, adversaries, or neutral agents) and, therefore, need to  consider the goals and motivations of these other agents when selecting  their own goals. More specifically, we consider agents that are members  of human-robot (or human-agent) teams. We have developed several  techniques that allow an agent to successfully integrate into a team,  including the ability to recognize the plans and goals of other agents,  modify an agent's goals in response to a detected change in teammates'  goals, coordinate with teammates on multi-agent tactics, and incorporate  teammate preferences during goal selection. Our Goal Reasoning agents  have been used to control autonomous ground vehicles and autonomous  aerial vehicles that are members of human-robot teams in simulated  scenarios. Additionally, preliminary results show that humans respond  positively to having a Goal Reasoning agent as a teammate. -->
